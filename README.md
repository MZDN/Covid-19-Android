## Data

ðŸ“‹ The data comes from the [2019 Novel Coronavirus (nCoV) Data Repository, provided
by JHU CCSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/2019-nCoV). It is
programmatically retrieved, re-formatted and stored in the server for one hour. ðŸ“‹

I've also programmed a skeduler on Heroku to run the refresh script every day since the data there is updated daily.
